### Falcon Support would not have been possible without support from Team 1466 Webb Robotics!

# Configuration Tips

### My Robot Spins around uncontrollably during autonomous or when attempting to set the heading!

* Invert the gyro scope.
* Invert the drive motors for every module. (If front and back become reversed when turning)

### Angle motors are erratic.

* Invert the angle motor.

### My robot is heavy.

* Implement momentum velocity limitations in SwerveMath.

### Ensure the IMU is centered on the robot
